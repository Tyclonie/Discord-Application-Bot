# Discord Application Bot
Developed By Tyclonie<br>
Setup Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDiUAc5tCOg

## Background Information
The bot was built a year before the public release and is also no longer updated by me and is potentially outdated. Before a couple of changes I made before publicly releasing the source code, the bot was designed to be distributed by Zap Development, but they chose not to.

## Licensing
Please abide by the license I have provided in license.txt while using the bot or modifying it.

## Useful Information
To run the bot all you require to download is Python, preferably 3.10 however the bot **should** work on newer/older versions of python.
Download Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

The external libraries required for my bot will automatically be downloaded upon running the bot for the first time.

Additional features like the welcome / leave messages are toggleable

Please be ready to input the bots details, make sure you have created a bot on the discord developer portal and also have the following:
- An application channel (where users can apply)
- A log channel (where applications are logged)
- A application manager role (allows users to use commands and accept/deny applicants)
- A welcome channel (to send leave and welcome messages) | THIS IS TOGGLEABLE
- A bot log channel (logs kick/ban/purge commands etc)

To explore the bot please use the commands:
- {prefix}help
- {prefix}settings

(replace {prefix} with the prefix you chose upon setting the bot up | make sure you have the application manager role you set to run the settings command)
