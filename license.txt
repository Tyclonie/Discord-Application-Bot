Please do not modify the code in any way which modifies any lines of code that credits me or links to the download page for the bot.

The bot is open sourced and anyone can change / modify the code. But the top line remains, I allow anyone to modify the code upon downloading and using the bot
I also allow forking and re-releasing but lines in which credit me (Tyclonie) cannot be modified. If you would wish to credit yourself, you may add another line
saying something like "Forked By: {your_name}".

Thanks for using the bot.
